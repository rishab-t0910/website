## [WHO Life Expectancy](https://github.com/rishab-t0910/who_life_expectancy)
Lanuages used: Python, R, Git

Duration: March - May 2024

The goal was to predict Life Expectancy based on the World Health Organization (WHO) data from 2006 - 2012. This was a project for [STAT 432: Basics of Statistical Learning](https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2024/spring/STAT/432) at UIUC. For this project, I used a Random Forest (regression) and a Logisitc Regression (classification) for my modelling. The Random Forest was able to predict life expectancy with a Test Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 3.2212 (very good), and the Logistic Regression with a Test Classification Error of 0.056 (also very good).
