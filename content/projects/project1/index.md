## [WHO Life Expectancy](https://github.com/rishab-t0910/who_life_expectancy)
Languages used: Python, R, Git

Duration: March - May 2024

The goal was to predict Life Expectancy based on the World Health Organization (WHO) data from 2006 - 2012. This was a project for [STAT 432: Basics of Statistical Learning](https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2024/spring/STAT/432) at UIUC. 

For this project, I used a Random Forest (regression) and a Logistic Regression (classification) for my modelling. The entire process and relevant files can be found on the [github repository](https://github.com/rishab-t0910/who_life_expectancy).

Results:
- Random Forest was able to predict life expectancy with a Test Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 3.2212 (very good)
- Logistic Regression with a Test Classification Error of 0.056 (also very good)

Overall, the modelling was a success, and it was fun to implement the skills and techniques I learned over the semester to a real life dataset.
