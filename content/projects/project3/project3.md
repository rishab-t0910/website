## [Monopoly Board Game Simulator](https://github.com/rishab-t0910/monopoly)
Lanuages used: Python

Duration: February 2024

The goal was to find the optimal playing strategy for multiple players for the classic Monopoly board game. I did this by simulating 1000 games with multiple players to find the return on investment of each property, proportion of occurances of each property amongst others. The entire process and relevant files can be found on the [github repository](https://github.com/rishab-t0910/monopoly).

Results:
- Chance, Community Chest, and Jail are the most landed on properties
- Other than brown and blue properties, all other properties have roughly the same proportion of landings
- Green properties make the most profit, and brown the least

This was a project that I first started around 2020 when I wasn't very experienced in Python and I used Openpxyl for my analysis. As I gained maturity, I recreated the program and used Matplotlib for my analysis.
